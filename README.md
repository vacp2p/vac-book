Welcome to the Vac book! This acts as a knowledge base for https://vac.dev/.

This replaces the somewhat-outdated Vac overview here: https://hackmd.io/@vac/main/

## About

- **topics** - Notes on various topics.
- **scratch** - Temporary, throw-away stuff.

## Contribute

Best used together with Obsidan, but any text editor works.

Core contributors SHOULD push directly to master.
