# README

Welcome to the Vac book! This acts as a knowledge base for https://vac.dev/.

This replaces the somewhat-outdated Vac overview here: https://hackmd.io/@vac/main/

## Organization

- **topics** - Notes on various topics; atemporal.
- **scratch** - Misc scratchpad, temporary; throw-away stuff.
- **plan** - plans for yearly/quarterly etc goals; temporal.

## Contribute

Best used together with Obsidan, but any text editor works.

Core contributors SHOULD push directly to master.
