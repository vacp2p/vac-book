Implementation of Waku in Nim. Overlaps with the research team, which is also ensuring this is production-ready. Initial research goes here, tight feedback loops and synergies with other research projects such as nim-libp2p, Nimbus, Dagger, etc.

We are in the process of building out a production team here.
