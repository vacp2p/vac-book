# Onboarding guide

Welcome to Vac! There's quite a lot to learn so take your time. Here are a few links and some things to start with:

## Collaboration Guideline 
Have a read of the link provided below to acquaint yourself with our collaboration best practices.
https://hackmd.io/phMs2XiOQD-NhNc-hHquLQ

## Starter tasks

- Try out the [Status app](http://status.im/)
- Get familiar with Nim
- Build [nwaku](https://hackmd.io/@vac/main/%2FXzV9Sap2S8SbVY15V8Ph-A). We encourage all core contributors to run a long-lived nwaku node as an operator. More details [here](https://hackmd.io/sSoTB3bmSDGtPnoCGtmYoQ?view).
- Skim specs (primarily Vac, but also Status) and try to get a picture of how things fit together. You do not have to read all the specifications all at once (it may get a bit confusing). We suggest start reading them in the following order, it is just a suggestion, feel free to do it the way you want!:). 
    * 1/COSS
    * 10/WAKU2
    * 16/WAKU2-RPC
    * 11/WAKU2-RELAY | 14/WAKU2-MESSAGE | 23/WAKU2-TOPICS | 26/WAKU2-PAYLOAD
    * 12/WAKU2-FILTER
    * 19/WAKU2-LIGHTPUSH
    * 13/WAKU2-STORE
    * 18/WAKU2-SWAP
    * 27/WAKU2-PEERS
    * 15/WAKU2-BRIDGE

    While reading RFCs note that there are two versions of WAKU namely WAKU1 and WAKU2. Vac RFCs related to WAKU2 are WAKU2 prefixed whereas other ones are prefixed by WAKU or WAKU1. For example, 8/WAKU-MAIL and 13/WAKU2-STORE are RFCs for WAKU1 and WAKU2, respectively.
